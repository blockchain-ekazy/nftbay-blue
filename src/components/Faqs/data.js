NFTs are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, and each transaction is recorded on the blockchain. However, because of the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network, transactions can sometimes take a while to process. This is especially true when there is a lot of traffic on the network (known as congestion). So, if you just purchased an NFT, it may take a while for that transaction to show up on the blockchain and be reflected in your ownership status.",
